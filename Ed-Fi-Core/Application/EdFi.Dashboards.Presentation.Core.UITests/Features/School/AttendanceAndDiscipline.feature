Feature: Attendance and Discipline
	In order to spot attendance and discipline issues
	As a dashboard user
	I want to see things

Scenario: Reviewing context menus
	Given I am logged on as the Superintendent
	And I am on the Attendance and Discipline page of the High School Academic Dashboard
	Then I should see the correct menu items for each metric action
